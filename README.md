# AWS Credential Switcher

Simple CLI tool that allows you to quickly toggle between AWS CLI profiles. It works by replacing the values of `default` profile with the profile you select.

> **NOTE:** This tool updates your local `~/.aws/credentials` file. Though we create a backup, it's recommended you create manual backup first.
